      Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. If anything in this life is certain, if
      history has taught us anything, it is that you can
      <span id="noun1">________</span> anyone. My father's name was Antonio
      Andolini... and this is for you. We're both part of the same hypocrisy,
      senator, but never think it applies to my family. I see you took the name
      of the <span id="noun2">____________</span>. What was your father's name?
      Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only don't tell me you're <span id="noun3">____________</span>. Because it
      insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. What's the matter with
      you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that
      <span id="noun4">____________</span> an orphan before he's born? Michael,
      you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! Don Corleone, I am honored and
      grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your
      daughter. And may their first child be a
      <span id="noun5">____________</span> child. You talk about vengeance. Is
      vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?
